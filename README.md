This is a project to create a form for generating CWL documents. It will not cover all of CWL, but most of the useful features.

CWL has many ways to do the same thing (such as defining input arrays). This generator will likely only implement one way to do something.

To run:

1) Install Node.js module http-server
https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server

2) Run `http-server .` in root dir
